# discord-bbcf-bot (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
This currently works by web scrapping the steam user page and checking for a join lobby link.  
User discord id to steam id is stored in self hosted firestore  
Technically I think this works beyond BBCF games  
Further updates coming to improve things such as  
- Use steam api link instead of webscrapping
- Add rate limit for requesting
